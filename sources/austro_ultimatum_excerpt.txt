*Commentary:*
Articles 5 and 6 were the most contentious. They demanded that Austro‑Hungarian police and judicial officials operate inside Serbia—a clear infringement of Serbian sovereignty. Vienna knew that no independent state could accept such terms without becoming a protectorate. The inclusion of these clauses indicates that the ultimatum was designed to be rejected, thereby furnishing a pretext for war.
