# The July Crisis: Day‑by‑Day Timeline (28 June – 4 August 1914)

*All dates are given in the Gregorian calendar. Times are Central European Time (CET) unless otherwise noted.*

---

## 28 June 1914
**Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie in Sarajevo.**  
*Time:* About 11:00 a.m.  
*Location:* Near the Latin Bridge, Sarajevo, Bosnia‑Herzegovina.  
*Perpetrators:* Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian‑nationalist group “Young Bosnia,” acting with support from the Black Hand (Ujedinjenje ili Smrt).

**Annotation**  
The assassination is documented in multiple eyewitness accounts and police reports. A key primary source is the **official Austrian judicial dossier** compiled after the arrest of the conspirators, which includes interrogations of Princip and his accomplices. These transcripts reveal the conspirators’ motives—to end Austro‑Hungarian rule in South Slavic lands—and the degree of assistance they received from Serbian military intelligence. The dossier is preserved in the Austrian State Archives (Haus‑, Hof‑ und Staatsarchiv, Vienna).

---

## 29 June – 4 July
**Initial reactions and diplomatic consultations.**  
Austro‑Hungarian officials, led by Foreign Minister Leopold Berchtold, begin to discuss a forceful response. In Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann‑Hollweg receive news of the assassination but do not yet commit to a specific course.

---

## 5–6 July
**The “Blank Cheque” meeting at Potsdam.**  
Austro‑Hungarian ambassador László Szögyény meets with Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Kaiser promises Germany’s full support for whatever action Austria‑Hungary decides to take against Serbia, effectively giving Vienna a “blank cheque.”

**Annotation**  
The German pledge is recorded in two telegrams sent by Szögyény to Vienna on 5 and 6 July. The **telegram of 6 July** (Nr. 277) quotes Wilhelm II as saying, “Should a war between Austria‑Hungary and Russia prove unavoidable, we could be convinced that Germany, our old faithful ally, would stand at our side.” This document is published in *Die Große Politik der Europäischen Kabinette 1871–1914* (Vol. 39, No. 15883). It illustrates Germany’s deliberate encouragement of a hard‑line Austrian policy, a crucial escalatory step.

---

## 7–22 July
**Austro‑Hungarian deliberation and drafting of the ultimatum.**  
A “war party” led by Chief of the General Staff Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf pushes for immediate military action. Berchtold and others favor presenting Serbia with an ultimatum designed to be rejected, thus providing a *casus belli*. The text is finalized on 19 July.

---

## 23 July
**Austro‑Hungarian ultimatum delivered to Serbia.**  
*Time:* 6:00 p.m.  
*Recipient:* Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić.  
The ultimatum gives Serbia **48 hours** to accept ten far‑reaching demands, including the suppression of anti‑Austrian propaganda, dismissal of officers implicated in the assassination, and the right for Austro‑Hungarian officials to participate in the investigation on Serbian soil.

**Annotation**  
The full text of the ultimatum is reproduced in many documentary collections. A convenient English translation appears in **British Documents on the Origins of the War, 1898–1914** (Vol. 11, No. 91). The wording of Articles 5 and 6—which demand Austrian participation in Serbia’s internal judicial and police affairs—was deliberately crafted to be unacceptable to a sovereign state, revealing Vienna’s intent to provoke a rejection and justify war.

---

## 24–25 July
**Serbian mobilization and diplomatic maneuvering.**  
Serbia orders partial mobilization on 24 July. On 25 July, after receiving assurances of Russian support, the Serbian government delivers its reply shortly before the 6:00 p.m. deadline.

**Serbia’s reply** accepts most demands but rejects Austrian participation in its internal investigation, offering instead to refer the matter to the International Court at The Hague. Austria‑Hungary immediately declares the reply unsatisfactory.

**Annotation**  
The Serbian note is printed in **Österreich‑Ungarns Außenpolitik 1908–1914** (Vol. 8, No. 10658). Its conciliatory tone and partial acceptance have led historians to debate whether a peaceful solution was still possible. The Austrian refusal to consider any compromise underscores the predetermined nature of the crisis.

---

## 26–27 July
**Attempts at mediation and further mobilizations.**  
Britain proposes a conference of great powers to resolve the crisis (the “Concert of Europe” initiative). Germany rejects the idea. Austria‑Hungary begins partial mobilization against Serbia on 26 July.

---

## 28 July
**Austria‑Hungary declares war on Serbia.**  
*Time:* 11:00 a.m.  
The declaration is telegraphed to Belgrade and read by the Austro‑Hungarian minister. Hostilities begin with the shelling of Belgrade the following day.

**Annotation**  
The declaration of war is preserved in the **Austrian diplomatic correspondence** (Haus‑, Hof‑ und Staatsarchiv, PA I, Karton 1049). Its language emphasizes Serbia’s failure to meet the ultimatum’s terms and the need to protect Austria‑Hungary’s “vital interests.” The document marks the point of no return: the first great‑power war declaration of what would become a world war.

---

## 29–30 July
**Russian general mobilization.**  
On 29 July, Tsar Nicholas II orders partial mobilization against Austria‑Hungary. Under pressure from his military, he signs the order for **general mobilization** on 30 July.

**Annotation**  
The mobilization order (Telegram No. 1557) is recorded in the **Russian military archives** and published in *Mezhdunarodnye otnosheniia v epokhu imperializma* (Series III, Vol. 5, No. 324). Russian generals argued that partial mobilization was technically unworkable and that delay would cede the strategic initiative to Germany. This decision triggered the German Schlieffen Plan, which required immediate war against France.

---

## 31 July
**German ultimatums to Russia and France.**  
Germany demands that Russia halt its mobilization within 12 hours (ultimatum expires 1 August, noon). Germany also asks France to declare its neutrality and to surrender the fortresses of Toul and Verdun as a guarantee—a demand Paris cannot accept.

---

## 1 August
**Germany declares war on Russia.**  
*Time:* 7:00 p.m.  
The German ambassador in St. Petersburg delivers the declaration. German troops begin crossing into Luxembourg that evening.

---

## 2 August
**Germany invades Luxembourg and demands free passage through Belgium.**  
Belgium refuses, citing its neutrality guaranteed by the 1839 Treaty of London.

---

## 3 August
**Germany declares war on France.**  
The declaration cites alleged French border violations and aerial incursions (the “Wiesbaden incident”).

---

## 4 August
**German invasion of Belgium; British ultimatum and declaration of war.**  
Britain demands that Germany respect Belgian neutrality by midnight (Berlin time). When no satisfactory reply is received, Britain declares war on Germany.

**Annotation**  
The British ultimatum is recorded in the **British Foreign Office papers** (FO 371/2166). Prime Minister Herbert Asquith’s statement to Parliament stressed that Britain’s obligation to defend Belgian neutrality, not just the Entente with France, compelled intervention. The document illustrates how the violation of a small power’s sovereignty transformed a continental war into a global conflict.
