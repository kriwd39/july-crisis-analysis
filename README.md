# The July Crisis Project

A collaborative digital historical project that analyzes the events of the July Crisis (June 28 – August 4, 1914).

- `/timeline` – Contains an annotated day‑by‑day timeline of the July Crisis.
- `/analysis` – Contains comparative analyses of key documents and decisions.
- `/sources` – Houses excerpts of primary sources referenced in the timeline and analyses.
- `/bios` – Contains short biographies of key political, military, and diplomatic figures.

## Intended Audience

- Students and educators studying the origins of World War I.
- Historians interested in collaborative digital history.
- Anyone seeking a balanced, multi‑perspective understanding of the July Crisis.
